# My Team was me(Aaron Mayo) and Samuel Anderson.
#We go to LHS
#Sam worked on code while I built the actual kit
#the problems we occured are really too many to count
#The main ones were the sensors not reading, lack of knowledge, and our pi was on the fritz for quite awhile
#I learned that i really do love coding, but it is much harder than i thought it would be.
#Click on all seperatly, run all individually to get readings
